Congress Installation Documentation
===================================

There are 2 ways to install Congress.

* As part of DevStack.  Get Congress running alongside other OpenStack services like Nova
  and Neutron, all on a single machine.  This is a great way to try out Congress for the
  first time.

* Separate install.  Get Congress running alongside an existing OpenStack
  deployment

.. _devstack_install:

Devstack install
--------------------
For integrating Congress with DevStack:

1. Download DevStack

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack.git
    $ cd devstack

2. Configure DevStack to use Congress and any other service you want.  To do that, modify
   the ``local.conf`` file (inside the DevStack directory).  Here is what
   our file looks like:

.. code-block:: console

    [[local|localrc]]

    enable_plugin congress https://opendev.org/openstack/congress
    enable_plugin heat https://opendev.org/openstack/heat
    enable_plugin aodh https://opendev.org/openstack/aodh
    enable_service s-proxy s-object s-container s-account
    # ENABLE_CONGRESS_JSON=True  # uncomment to enable the jgress feature

3. Run ``stack.sh``.  The default configuration expects the passwords to be 'password'
   without the quotes

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./stack.sh

Enabling Optional features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Config validator datasource
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you want to use the config datasource in a multi-node
environment, you must configure the Congress agent and
only the agent on the other nodes. Here is the relevant part
of ``local.conf``:

.. code-block:: console

    enable_plugin congress https://opendev.org/openstack/congress
    disable_service congress congress-api congress-engine congress-datasources
    enable_service congress-agent

By default, the datasource is enabled for the nova, neutron and Congress services. To enable it for other services, you can define the variable ``VALIDATOR_SERVICES``.

The ``ENABLE_CONGRESS_AGENT`` variable in ``local.conf`` controls the
availability of the config datasource and its agent in devstack. Set it to
``False`` to disable it (default value is ``True``).

JGress - Congress JSON Ingester (experimental)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To enable the experimental JSON Ingester feature, set the
``ENABLE_CONGRESS_JSON`` variable to ``True`` in ``local.conf``.

Z3 Engine (experimental)
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To enable the use of the experimental Z3 as an alternate Datalog engine, the
``ENABLE_CONGRESS_Z3`` variable must be set to ``True`` in ``local.conf``.
You can use a pre-compiled release if your OS supports it (Ubuntu, Debian)
by setting ``USE_Z3_RELEASE`` to the number of an existing release
(eg. ``4.7.1``).

Separate install
--------------------
Install the following software, if you haven't already.

* python 2.7: https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/

* pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html

* java: https://java.com  (any reasonably current version should work)
  On Ubuntu:   console apt-get install default-jre
  On Federa:   console yum install jre

* z3 (optional): if you want to use z3, install it following the 
  instructions at https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3

* Additionally

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo apt install git gcc python-dev python-antlr3 libxml2 libxslt1-dev libzip-dev build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev libpq-dev
  $ sudo apt install rabbitmq-server  # https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html
  $ sudo apt install python-setuptools
  $ sudo pip install --upgrade pip virtualenv pbr tox

Clone Congress

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/openstack/congress.git
  $ cd congress

Install requirements

.. code-block:: console

 $ sudo pip install .

Install Source code

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo python setup.py install

Configure Congress  (Assume you put config files in /etc/congress)

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/congress
  $ sudo cp etc/api-paste.ini /etc/congress

(optional) Customize API access policy
  Typically, the default access policy of Congress API is appropriate.
  If desired, you can override the default access policy as follows:

.. code-block:: console

  $ tox -e genpolicy
  (edit the generated sample file etc/policy.yaml.sample then copy to conf dir)
  $ sudo cp etc/policy.yaml.sample /etc/congress/policy.yaml

(optional) Set-up policy library
  This step copies the bundled collection Congress policies into the Congress
  policy library for easy activation by an administrator. The policies in the
  library do not become active until explicitly activated by an administrator.
  The step may be skipped if you do not want to load the bundled policies into
  the policy library.

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo cp -r library /etc/congress/.

Generate a configuration file as outlined in the Configuration Options section
of the :ref:`Deployment <deployment>` document. Note: you may have to run the command with sudo.

There are several sections in the congress/etc/congress.conf.sample file you may want to change:

* [DEFAULT] Section
    - auth_strategy
* "From oslo.log" Section
    - log_file
    - log_dir (remember to create the directory)
* [database] Section
    - connection

The default auth_strategy is keystone. To set Congress to use no authorization strategy:

.. code-block:: text

    auth_strategy = noauth

If you use noauth, you might want to delete or comment out the [keystone_authtoken] section.

Set the database connection string in the [database] section (adapt MySQL root password):

.. code-block:: text

    connection = mysql+pymysql://root:password@127.0.0.1/congress?charset=utf8

To use RabbitMQ with Congress, set the transport_url in the "From oslo.messaging" section according to your setup:

.. code-block:: text

    transport_url = rabbit://$RABBIT_USERID:$RABBIT_PASSWORD@$RABBIT_HOST:5672

A bare-bones congress.conf is as follows:

.. code-block:: text

  [DEFAULT]
  auth_strategy = noauth
  log_file=congress.log
  log_dir=/var/log/congress
  [database]
  connection = mysql+pymysql://root:password@127.0.0.1/congress?charset=utf8


When you are finished editing congress.conf.sample, copy it to the /etc/congress directory.

.. code-block:: console

    sudo cp etc/congress.conf.sample /etc/congress/congress.conf


Create database

.. code-block:: console

  $ mysql -u root -p
  $ mysql> CREATE DATABASE congress;
  $ mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON congress.* TO 'congress'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'CONGRESS_DBPASS';
  $ mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON congress.* TO 'congress'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'CONGRESS_DBPASS';


Push down schema

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo congress-db-manage --config-file /etc/congress/congress.conf upgrade head


Set up Congress accounts
  Use your OpenStack RC file to set and export required environment variables:
  OS_USERNAME, OS_PASSWORD, OS_PROJECT_NAME, OS_TENANT_NAME, OS_AUTH_URL.

  (Adapt parameters according to your environment)


.. code-block:: console

  $ ADMIN_ROLE=$(openstack role list | awk "/ admin / { print \$2 }")
  $ SERVICE_TENANT=$(openstack project list | awk "/ service / { print \$2 }")
  $ CONGRESS_USER=$(openstack user create --password password --project service --email "congress@example.com" congress | awk "/ id / {print \$4 }")
  $ openstack role add $ADMIN_ROLE --user $CONGRESS_USER --project  $SERVICE_TENANT
  $ CONGRESS_SERVICE=$(openstack service create policy --name congress --description "Congress Service" | awk "/ id / { print \$4 }")


Create the Congress Service Endpoint
  Endpoint creation differs based upon the Identity version. Please see the `endpoint <https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/command-objects/endpoint.html>`_ documentation for details.


.. code-block:: console

  Identity v2:
  $ openstack endpoint create $CONGRESS_SERVICE --region RegionOne --publicurl https://127.0.0.1:1789/  --adminurl https://127.0.0.1:1789/ --internalurl https://127.0.0.1:1789/


.. code-block:: console

  Identity v3:
  $ openstack endpoint create --region $OS_REGION_NAME  $CONGRESS_SERVICE public https://$SERVICE_HOST:1789
  $ openstack endpoint create --region $OS_REGION_NAME  $CONGRESS_SERVICE admin https://$SERVICE_HOST:1789
  $ openstack endpoint create --region $OS_REGION_NAME  $CONGRESS_SERVICE internal https://$SERVICE_HOST:1789



Start Congress
  The default behavior is to start the Congress API, Policy Engine, and
  Datasource in a single node. For HAHT deployment options, please see the
  :ref:`HA Overview <ha_overview>` document.

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo /usr/local/bin/congress-server --debug


Install the Congress Client
  The command line interface (CLI) for Congress resides in a project called python-congressclient.
  Follow the installation instructions on the `GitHub page <https://github.com/openstack/python-congressclient>`_.


Configure datasource drivers
  For this you must have the Congress CLI installed. Run this command for every
  service that Congress will poll for  data.
  Please note that the service name $SERVICE should match the ID of the
  datasource driver, e.g. "neutronv2" for Neutron and "glancev2" for Glance;
  $OS_USERNAME, $OS_TENANT_NAME, $OS_PASSWORD and $SERVICE_HOST are used to
  configure the related datasource driver so that congress knows how to
  talk with the service.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack congress datasource create $SERVICE $"SERVICE" \
    --config username=$OS_USERNAME \
    --config tenant_name=$OS_TENANT_NAME
    --config password=$OS_PASSWORD
    --config auth_url=https://$SERVICE_HOST:5000/v3


Install the Congress Dashboard plugin in Horizon
  Clone congress-dashboard repo, located here https://github.com/openstack/congress-dashboard
  Follow the instructions in the README file located in https://github.com/openstack/congress-dashboard/blob/master/README.rst
  for further installation.

  Note: After you install the Congress Dashboard and restart apache, the OpenStack Dashboard may throw
  a "You have offline compression enabled..." error, follow the instructions in the error message.
  You may have to:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd /opt/stack/horizon
  $ python manage.py compress
  $ sudo service apache2 restart


Read the HTML documentation
  Install python-sphinx and the oslosphinx extension if missing and build the docs.
  After building, open congress/doc/html/index.html in a browser.

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo pip install sphinx
  $ sudo pip install oslosphinx
  $ make docs


Test Using the Congress CLI
  If you are not familiar with using the OpenStack command-line clients, please read the `OpenStack documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/cli.html>`_ before proceeding.

  Once you have set up or obtained credentials to use the OpenStack command-line clients, you may begin testing Congress. During installation a number of policies are created.

  To view policies: $ openstack congress policy list

  To view installed datasources: $ openstack congress datasource list

  To list available commands: $ openstack congress --help


Upgrade
-----------

Here are the instructions for upgrading to a new release of the
Congress server.

1. Stop the Congress server.

2. Update the Congress git repo

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd /path/to/congress
  $ git fetch origin

3. Checkout the release you are interested in, say Mitaka.  Note that this
step will not succeed if you have any uncommitted changes in the repo.

.. code-block:: console

  $ git checkout origin/stable/mitaka


If you have changes committed locally that are not merged into the public
repository, you now need to cherry-pick those changes onto the new
branch.

4. Install dependencies

.. code-block:: console

 $ sudo pip install

5. Install source code

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo python setup.py install

6. Migrate the database schema

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo congress-db-manage --config-file /etc/congress/congress.conf upgrade head

7. (optional) Check if the configuration options you are currently using are
   still supported and whether there are any new configuration options you
   would like to use.  To see the current list of configuration options,
   use the following command, which will create a sample configuration file
   in ``etc/congress.conf.sample`` for you to examine.

.. code-block:: console

   $ tox -egenconfig

8. Restart Congress, e.g.

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo /usr/local/bin/congress-server --debug
